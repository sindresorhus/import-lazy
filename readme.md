# import-lazy [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/import-lazy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/import-lazy)

> Import a module lazily


## Install

```
$ npm install import-lazy
```


## Usage

```js
// Pass in `require` or a custom import function
const importLazy = require('import-lazy')(require);
const _ = importLazy('lodash');

// Instead of referring to its exported properties directly…
_.isNumber(2);

// …it's cached on consecutive calls
_.isNumber('unicorn');

// Works out of the box for functions and regular properties
const stuff = importLazy('./math-lib');
console.log(stuff.sum(1, 2)); // => 3
console.log(stuff.PHI); // => 1.618033
```


## Note

### Destructuring will cause it to fetch eagerly

While you may be tempted to do leverage destructuring, like this:

```js
const {isNumber, isString} = importLazy('lodash');
```

Note that this will cause immediate property access, negating the lazy loading, and is equivalent to:

```js
import {isNumber, isString} from 'lodash';
```

### Usage with bundlers

If you're using a bundler, like Webpack, you'll have to [import your modules like this](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/9155) in order to have them properly bundled:

```js
const importLazy = require('import-lazy');

const _ = importLazy(() => require('lodash'))();
```
